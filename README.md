# Framer Motion â€“ React Animation Demo

This repository demonstrates my learning and implementation of **Framer Motion**, a production-ready animation library for React.  
It provides a declarative API to create **smooth, performant, and interactive animations** with minimal code.

## ðŸ“Œ About Framer Motion
- Built specifically for React.
- Uses `motion` components (`motion.div`, `motion.img`, etc.) to add animations directly in JSX.
- Supports entry/exit animations, gestures (`whileHover`, `whileTap`), keyframes, layout transitions, and scroll-based effects.
- Highly optimized for performance with interruptible animations.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Shows
- Component mount animations (fade + slide).
- Hover-based scaling animations.
- Clean, maintainable animation code using Framer Motion props.
